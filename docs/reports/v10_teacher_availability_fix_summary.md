# V10 Teacher Availability Fix Summary

## Problem
The V10 implementation of Ultrathink Perfect Generator has a critical issue in the `_initialize_teacher_availability` method. It fails to detect existing teacher assignments from the initial schedule because:

1. The initial schedule loaded from input.csv doesn't contain teacher information
2. The method checks `assignment.teacher` which is always None for assignments from input.csv
3. As a result, 0 existing teacher assignments are detected when there are actually 515 initial assignments

## Root Cause
```python
# V10 Original - Line 134-136
teacher = assignment.teacher
if not teacher:
    teacher = school.get_assigned_teacher(assignment.subject, assignment.class_ref)
```

The issue is that even though the code tries to get the teacher from school when assignment.teacher is None, the Subject object is not created correctly, causing the lookup to fail.

## Solution in V10 Fixed
The fixed version properly creates a Subject object before calling get_assigned_teacher:

```python
# V10 Fixed - Line 134-140
teacher = assignment.teacher
if not teacher:
    # 重要: Subject objectを作成して正しく取得
    subject_obj = Subject(assignment.subject.name)
    teacher = school.get_assigned_teacher(subject_obj, assignment.class_ref)
    
    if teacher:
        logger.debug(f"教師を推定: {assignment.class_ref} {assignment.subject.name} → {teacher.name}先生")
```

## Key Changes
1. **Proper Subject object creation**: Creates a new Subject object from the subject name
2. **Enhanced logging**: Adds debug logging to track when teachers are inferred
3. **Statistics tracking**: Adds `existing_teacher_assignments` to stats for visibility

## Test Results
The simplified test shows:
- V10 Original: 0 existing teacher assignments detected
- V10 Fixed: 5 existing teacher assignments detected (correctly)

Example of correctly detected assignments:
- 井野口先生: Mon 4th period (1-1 国), Tue 4th period (1-1 数)
- 塚本先生: Tue 5th period (2-1 国)
- 野口先生: Mon 4th period (2-1 英)

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. Teachers are not double-booked for time slots where they already have assignments
2. The backtracking algorithm has accurate teacher availability information
3. The generated timetable respects existing teacher assignments from the initial schedule
