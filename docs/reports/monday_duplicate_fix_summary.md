# Monday Daily Duplicate Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

### Initial Issues Found
1. **Grade 5 Classes (1-5, 2-5, 3-5)**:
   - Had PE (保) scheduled 3 times on Monday (periods 2, 3, and 5)
   - This violated the daily duplicate constraint (1 subject per day maximum)
   - All three Grade 5 classes had identical schedules due to synchronization

2. **Other Classes with Monday Duplicates**:
   - 1年1組: 国 appeared twice (periods 1 and 5)
   - 1年3組: 英 appeared twice (periods 3 and 4)
   - 1年7組: 国 appeared twice (periods 1 and 2)
   - 2年2組: 英 appeared twice (periods 1 and 3)

3. **Other Daily Duplicates**:
   - 1年6組: 国 appeared twice on Friday
   - 3年6組: 理 appeared twice on Tuesday

**Total violations: 9 daily duplicate issues**

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Immediate Fix (Completed)
Used `fix_daily_duplicates_simple_v2.py` to replace duplicate occurrences:
- Kept the first occurrence of each subject
- Replaced subsequent occurrences with unused subjects
- Prioritized main subjects (数, 国, 英, 理, 社, 算) for replacements
- Maintained Grade 5 synchronization

**Result**: All 9 duplicate violations were fixed ✓

### 2. Preventive Measures Implemented

#### A. Daily Duplicate Preventer Service
Created `DailyDuplicatePreventer` service that:
- Pre-checks before placing any subject
- Maintains cache of daily subject counts
- Provides safe subject suggestions
- Special handling for Grade 5 synchronization

#### B. Enhanced Smart Empty Slot Filler
Updated the `SmartEmptySlotFiller` to:
- Use `DailyDuplicatePreventer` before placing subjects
- Check all Grade 5 classes together for safe subjects
- Clear caches after each assignment
- Track blocked assignments due to duplicate prevention

### 3. Root Cause Analysis

The daily duplicates occurred because:
1. **Insufficient pre-checks**: The empty slot filler wasn't checking daily counts before placement
2. **Grade 5 synchronization issues**: When filling Grade 5 slots, the system didn't check if the subject already appeared that day
3. **Strategy relaxation**: Later filling strategies (relaxed, ultra-relaxed) allowed up to 3 occurrences per day
4. **Cache management**: Daily counts weren't being properly tracked during the filling process

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### 1. Strategy Adjustments
- **Strict mode**: Keep 1 per day limit for all subjects
- **Balanced mode**: Allow 2 per day only for main subjects, with careful tracking
- **Relaxed modes**: Should still respect the 1 per day limit but relax other constraints

### 2. Grade 5 Special Handling
- Always check all three Grade 5 classes together
- Find subjects that are safe for ALL three classes before placement
- Maintain a separate tracking system for Grade 5 daily counts

### 3. Pre-emptive Validation
- Run daily duplicate checks after each assignment
- Implement rollback mechanism if violations are detected
- Add warnings when approaching daily limits

### 4. Configuration Options
Consider adding configuration for:
```python
daily_limits = {
    'default': 1,
    'main_subjects': {'数', '国', '英', '理', '社', '算'}: 2,  # Only in relaxed mode
    'special_subjects': {'保', '音', '美', '技', '家'}: 1
}
```

### 5. Testing Recommendations
- Add unit tests for `DailyDuplicatePreventer`
- Test Grade 5 synchronization with daily limits
- Verify all filling strategies respect daily limits
- Add integration tests for complete schedule generation

## Conclusion

The immediate issue has been resolved, and preventive measures have been implemented. The system now has:
1. ✓ Fixed all 9 daily duplicate violations
2. ✓ Pre-emptive duplicate prevention service
3. ✓ Enhanced empty slot filler with duplicate checks
4. ✓ Special handling for Grade 5 synchronization

The daily duplicate constraint is now being enforced more strictly throughout the schedule generation and empty slot filling process.
