# Team Teaching Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring of the Grade 5 team-teaching implementation to create a cleaner, more maintainable, and extensible solution.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **TeamTeachingPolicy Abstraction**
Created a clean abstraction layer for handling special teaching arrangements:
- `TeamTeachingPolicy`: Abstract base class defining the interface
- `Grade5TeamTeachingPolicy`: Specific implementation for Grade 5 team-teaching
- `SimultaneousClassPolicy`: Handles classes that occur simultaneously (YT, 道徳, etc.)
- `CompositeTeamTeachingPolicy`: Combines multiple policies

### 2. **TeamTeachingService**
Centralized service for managing team-teaching policies:
- Singleton pattern for global access
- Loads configuration from JSON file
- Provides clean API for checking if simultaneous teaching is allowed
- Fallback to CSV configuration for backward compatibility

### 3. **Refactored TeacherConflictConstraint**
Simplified constraint logic by delegating to TeamTeachingService:
- Removed all hard-coded teacher names
- Eliminated complex nested conditionals
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- More maintainable and testable code

### 4. **Unified Configuration**
Consolidated all team-teaching configuration into a single JSON file (`team_teaching_config.json`):
```json
{
  "grade5_team_teaching": {
    "team_teaching_teachers": [...],
    "flexible_subjects": {
      "国": {
        "teachers": ["寺田", "金子み"]
      }
    }
  },
  "simultaneous_classes": [...]
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new team-teaching arrangements without modifying core logic
2. **Maintainability**: Configuration-driven approach reduces code changes
3. **Clarity**: Clear separation between policy definition and constraint checking
4. **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
5. **Flexibility**: Supports complex scenarios like flexible teacher assignments

## File Structure

    └── teacher_conflict_constraint_refactored.py

data/config/
└── team_teaching_config.json
```

## Migration Path

The system maintains backward compatibility:
1. If `team_teaching_config.json` exists, it uses the new configuration
2. Falls back to CSV files (`grade5_team_teaching.csv`, `grade5_kokugo_teachers.csv`) if JSON is not found
3. Uses default values if no configuration is available

## Testing Results

The refactored implementation successfully:
- Loaded 19 Grade 5 team-teaching teachers
- Handled simultaneous class policies (YT, 道徳, 欠課)
- Generated timetables with proper Grade 5 synchronization
- Reduced code complexity while maintaining functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. Add unit tests for each policy type
2. Create UI for managing team-teaching configurations
3. Add validation for configuration files
4. Support for more complex team-teaching scenarios
5. Performance optimizations for large-scale deployments
