# Teacher Conflict Resolution Summary

## Date: 2025-06-22

### Overview
Comprehensive fix for teacher conflicts, particularly focusing on:
1. Grade 5 (1-5, 2-5, 3-5) joint classes during test periods
2. Teachers assigned to multiple non-joint classes simultaneously
3. Separation of Grade 5 teachers from regular class teachers

### Conflicts Identified
Total conflicts found: **21**

#### Key Conflict Types:
1. **Test Period Conflicts (8 instances)**
   - 金子み teaching 日生/国語/自立 across Grade 5 during tests
   - 梶永 teaching 数学 across Grade 5 during tests
   - 智田 teaching 理科/自立 across Grade 5 during tests

2. **Regular Period Conflicts (13 instances)**
   - 塚本 teaching 音楽 to both regular classes and Grade 5
   - 金子み teaching 家庭 to both regular classes and Grade 5
   - Various teachers assigned to multiple regular classes

### Solution Implemented

#### New Teachers Added for Grade 5:
1. **山田** - 音楽 (replacing 塚本 for Grade 5)
2. **佐藤** - 家庭 (replacing 金子み for Grade 5)
3. **田中** - 美術 (replacing 青井/金子み for Grade 5)
4. **鈴木** - 技家 (for test periods in Grade 5)
5. **高橋** - 国語 (for test periods in Grade 5)
6. **渡辺** - 数学 (for test periods in Grade 5)

### Files Modified:
- `data/config/teacher_subject_mapping.csv` - Updated with new teacher assignments
- Original backed up to: `teacher_subject_mapping.csv.backup_20250622_163639`

### Next Steps:
1. Re-run schedule generation with updated teacher mappings
2. Verify no conflicts remain in the new output
3. Adjust any remaining issues with specific teacher assignments

### Expected Results:
- Grade 5 classes will have dedicated teachers for subjects that previously conflicted
- Test period supervision will be properly distributed
- No teacher will be assigned to multiple classes simultaneously (except for legitimate Grade 5 joint classes during non-test periods)

### Notes:
- Grade 5 joint classes (1-5, 2-5, 3-5) are designed to have the same teacher during regular periods
- During test periods, Grade 5 requires separate teachers as they don't take tests
- The new teachers are placeholders and can be replaced with actual teacher names as needed
