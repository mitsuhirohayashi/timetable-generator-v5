# Test Period Teacher Supervision Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the rule that allows teachers to supervise multiple classes simultaneously during test periods, as they patrol between classrooms while students take tests.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified TeacherConflictConstraintRefactored
**File**: `src/domain/constraints/teacher_conflict_constraint_refactored.py`

**Key Changes**:
- Added import for `TestPeriodProtector` service
- Initialized `test_period_protector` in the constructor
- Added test period check in both `check()` and `validate()` methods
- When a time slot is identified as a test period, the constraint skips the teacher duplication check

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# In check() method (line 34-35):
if self.test_period_protector.is_test_period(time_slot):
    return True  # Allow multiple classes during test periods

# In validate() method (line 109-110):
if self.test_period_protector.is_test_period(time_slot):
    continue  # Skip violation check for test periods
```

## Test Period Detection
The system correctly identifies test periods from Follow-up.csv:
- **Monday**: 1st-3rd periods (月曜1-3校時)
- **Tuesday**: 1st-3rd periods (火曜1-3校時)  
- **Wednesday**: 1st-2nd periods (水曜1-2校時)

## Results

### Before Implementation
- Teachers teaching multiple classes during test periods were flagged as violations
- Example: 井上先生 teaching math to 2年1組, 2年2組, 2年3組 simultaneously would be a violation

### After Implementation
- Test periods are correctly detected and teacher duplications are allowed
- During test periods, teachers can supervise multiple classes without triggering violations
- Non-test period duplications are still properly detected as violations

### Verified Examples
During test periods, the following are now allowed:
- 井上先生: Teaching 3 math classes simultaneously (月曜1校時)
- 金子ひ先生: Teaching 3 science classes simultaneously (水曜1校時)
- 林先生: Teaching multiple technical/home economics classes during test periods

## Violation Count Impact
- Total teacher conflict violations reduced from potentially higher count to 33
- The 33 remaining violations are all from non-test periods, which is correct behavior

## Technical Notes
1. The `TestPeriodProtector` service automatically loads test period information from Follow-up.csv
2. The test period check is performed before any teacher conflict validation
3. The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing constraint system
4. Debug output has been cleaned up for production use

## Files Modified
1. `src/domain/constraints/teacher_conflict_constraint_refactored.py`
   - Added test period exclusion logic
   - Removed excessive debug output for cleaner logs

## Existing Infrastructure Used
- `TestPeriodProtector` service (already implemented)
- `TestPeriodExclusionConstraint` (exists but not directly used)
- Enhanced Follow-up parser for test period detection
